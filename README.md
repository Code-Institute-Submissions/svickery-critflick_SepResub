A website designed for movie fans around the world to post their own reviews of movies. It's purpose is to be an alternative to the status quo of movie reviewers working in the industry today. While most professional reviewers are looking for the most "worthy" of movies, CritFlick aims to give the opinion back to the people. 

Users can become a member almost instantly and start writing their reviews for the rest of the world to see. Anyone can read the reviews, but to write one you have to join. It is free and the only goal is to spread word the about movies new or old. 

The user goals of the website are as follows:

* See reviews of movies new and old
* To be able to search for a movie review
* To join the website
* Once the user has joined, they would like to contribute reviews
* To be able to add, delete and edit their reviews
* Have the option to log in and out of website
* See details of movies. Title, genre, director, actor etc.

The website has a scrolling effect on the index page and reviews page using a parallax effect. This is so the website not only looks good but also be navigated easily. There are seperate pages for different needs such as sign up form, log in form and add review form once a member. The navigation bar has been fixed at the top so that all pages are available during use of the site. In total there are nine pages available to use. However if you are not a member there are only four pages to view. On the reviews page there is a search bar to search for whichever movie they would like to see a review of. There is a footer with social media links at the bottom of each page. This footer also contatins copyright information.

The name of the site also appears as a header and there is no logo used for the site.

Below this image there are then cards which have large eye catching images and beneath those images, there is all the information you would need about a movie. Below that further is the review of the movie. This review section has a scrolling effect so that the user doesn't have to navigate elsewhere to read it in its full form. At the bottom of the review is the contributors name.

## Technologies Used

* The project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages. 
* [Github](https://github.com/) - I used this for all coding (IDE) while building the website.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) - Used for grid layouts and cards on my page. Also allowed me to use Font Awesome icons for my social media links. 
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used for social link icons in conjuction with bootstrap. 
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used for entire website fonts.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Used for styling forms etc from bootstrap. 
* [Web Formatter](https://webformatter.com/) - Used to make my code cleaner and easier to read.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Used to help with contact form and other various coding questions.
* [JSfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/QN9cH/1/) - This was to help with parallax scrolling effect on iOS mobile devices. 
* [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - Used to ensure CSS is correct
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Used for JQuery elements applied in JavaScript and some help with writing code.
* [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) - JavaScript code given to make Contact Form functional.
* [Trip Advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/) - Used for the attraction locations.
* [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - Used to ensure HTML is correct.
* [JS Lint](https://jslint.com/) - Used to ensure JavaScript is correct.

## Testing

To test the website, the project code was run through both a Markup checker, a CSS checker and a JavaScript checker, below are the screenshots of the results and explanations. 

[Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) 

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/critflick/blob/a34fd119aa083fdadd7bcf025550fc65077fbb73/readme/HTML-Validator.jpg "HTML Validator")

The errors that have shown up are ones that can't be avoided. The errors are either in the head or the scripts section. The validator doesn't recognise jquery correctly and the head data is from VS Code's own template. 

[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ "CSS Validator") 

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/critflick/blob/a34fd119aa083fdadd7bcf025550fc65077fbb73/readme/CSS-Validator.jpg "CSS Validator")

The errors shown here are from a getbootstrap styling I used which the validator does not recognise.

[JavaScript Validator](https://jslint.com/)

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/EnjoyBristol/blob/0615e651905015a80874b49bb45a6d6527edafd5/assets/img/JSMaps1.jpg "JavaScript Validator")

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/critflick/blob/a34fd119aa083fdadd7bcf025550fc65077fbb73/readme/JSLint.jpg)

The JS validator shows up some issues with certain characters being used, such as the use of '$' and to use double quotes. However this would make the code unusable. Validator doesn't seem to recognise jquery.
