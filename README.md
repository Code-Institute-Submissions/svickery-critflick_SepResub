A website designed for movie fans around the world to post their own reviews of movies. It's purpose is to be an alternative to the status quo of movie reviewers working in the industry today. While most professional reviewers are looking for the most "worthy" of movies, CritFlick aims to give the opinion back to the people. 

Users can become a member almost instantly and start writing their reviews for the rest of the world to see. Anyone can read the reviews, but to write one you have to join. It is free and the only goal is to spread word the about movies new or old. 

The user goals of the website are as follows:

* See reviews of movies new and old
* To be able to search for a movie review
* To join the website
* Once the user has joined, they would like to contribute reviews
* To be able to add, delete and edit their reviews
* Have the option to log in and out of website
* See details of movies. Title, genre, director, actor etc.

#### Wireframes:

[View Wireframes Here](https://www.figma.com/file/TLfVJCGUaDK7M33SHrGGYG/CritFlick?node-id=0%3A1)

The site changed a lot from its original conception. Time constraints didn't allow me to use a Movie API to show current cinema listings and the color scheme was changed to a darker effect to replicate the cinema feel. I had to change a lot of cards etc to make the site work correctly. 

## Features

The website has a scrolling effect on the index page and reviews page using a parallax effect. This is so the website not only looks good but also be navigated easily. There are seperate pages for different needs such as sign up form, log in form and add review form once a member. The navigation bar has been fixed at the top so that all pages are available during use of the site. In total there are nine pages available to use. However if you are not a member there are only four pages to view. On the reviews page there is a search bar to search for whichever movie they would like to see a review of. There is a footer with social media links at the bottom of each page. This footer also contatins copyright information.  

#### Home

The Home page features one large photography covering the top of the page. This includes hero text on the image. The hero text has a link to join the website as a member. Below the image there is an about section explaining to the user what the website is for and how they can get involved themselves. The name of the site also appears as a header and there is no logo used for the site. 

#### Reviews

The reviews page has a similar layout to the home page with a large image at the top and hero text allowing the user to join as a member easily. Below this image there are then cards which have large eye catching images and beneath those images, there is all the information you would need about a movie. Below that further is the review of the movie. This review section has a scrolling effect so that the user doesn't have to navigate elsewhere to read it in its full form. At the bottom of the review is the contributors name.  

#### Sign Up

A page linked on both the home and review pages. There is a basic form for your details to become a contributor to the site. This form also has a link to the terms and conditions of the website.   

#### Log In

This page has a simple log in form for users who are already members. 

#### Profile 

Once a user has logged in, they will be redirected immediately to their own profile page. This has a flash message to welcome the user, a title for the profile user and an add review button underneath. This is designed to encourage the user to contribute immediately. Beneath that the user will be able to see all their past reviews they have written. Each review has an option to edit and delete in bold red. The edit function opens a new page.

#### Add Review

Located in the navigation bar as well as being able to from the previously mentioned add review button on the profile page. Users can add a review whenever the choose and will be given a simple form to follow. This includes a url link for the user to add for the review. Once the information is complete and the review is written, there is a submit button to add this to the site. This review will be visible to all people navigating to the site. 

#### Edit Review

This is not available in the navigation but links directly from the edit button. This page will render all the previous information supplied in the review.

This is located in the navbar and is only a single click function. 

#### Terms and Conditions

#### Possible Future Features

* Use an API to bring local current showing times in cinemas near them. 
* A comments section for each review. Only members are allowed to use this.
* Could be expanded to include TV shows also.

## Technologies Used

* The project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages. 
* [Github](https://github.com/) - I used this for all coding (IDE) while building the website.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) - Used for grid layouts and cards on my page. Also allowed me to use Font Awesome icons for my social media links. 
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used for icons in conjuction with bootstrap. 
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used for entire website fonts.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Used for styling forms etc from bootstrap. 
* [Web Formatter](https://webformatter.com/) - Used to make my code cleaner and easier to read.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Used to help with various coding questions.
* [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - Used to ensure CSS is correct
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Used for JQuery elements applied in JavaScript and some help with writing code.
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) - Used to have reviews added to site.
* [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - Used to ensure HTML is correct.
* [JS Lint](https://jslint.com/) - Used to ensure JavaScript is correct.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Language used to present data.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database used for site data schema.
* [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) - Templating language used with Python and Flask.
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) - Web framework used with Python.
* [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) - Cloud based app for deploying websites.

## Database Schema

As you can see in the below pictures, I had two clusters from movie_datbase, called reviews and users. Reviews is purely for the information given by a contributer to the site for their review. Users data is their login name and password (not visible).

## Testing

To test the website, the project code was run through both a Markup checker, a CSS checker and a JavaScript checker, below are the screenshots of the results and explanations. 

[Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) 

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/critflick/blob/a34fd119aa083fdadd7bcf025550fc65077fbb73/testing/html-validator.jpg "HTML Validator")

The errors that have shown up are ones that can't be avoided. The errors are either in the head or the scripts section. The validator doesn't recognise jquery correctly and the head data is from VS Code's own template. 

[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ "CSS Validator") 

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/critflick/blob/2796c3f2706650385ec1dc2cf1d364602bac0874/testing/css-validator.jpg "CSS Validator")

The errors shown here are from a getbootstrap styling I used which the validator does not recognise.

[JavaScript Validator](https://jslint.com/)

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/critflick/blob/a34fd119aa083fdadd7bcf025550fc65077fbb73/testing/jslint.jpg)

The JS validator shows up some issues with certain characters being used, such as the use of '$' and to use double quotes. However this would make the code unusable. Validator doesn't seem to recognise jquery.
